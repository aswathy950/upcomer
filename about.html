      <h1>Why we do what we do</h1>
      <p>
        We believe that it should be easy, fun and rewarding to stay updated on upcoming products that you care about. We do also believe that we as customers should have the possibility to be more involved in the development of upcoming products which will result
        in better products. And that the brands behind the product will benefit greatly from a closer relationship with their customers during the product development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upcomer is built upon these beliefs and with your help we will build the next big thing, to let the people know about the next big things!
